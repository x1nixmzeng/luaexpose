luaexpose
=========

A Lua/OpenGl data format experiment.

This tool will allow exploration of known and unknown model formats using Lua script. Using the custom methods, vertex data can be tested on-the-fly in a 3D environment and quickly help discover how the data is stored.


## Usage

See the [wiki](/wiki) to learn how to get started. Scripts are stored in `core.lua`, and automatically reloaded when resaved.


## Screenshot

Consider how much easier it is to load data (http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=3739)[from this tutorial] with **luaexpose**!
