luaexpose
=========

A Lua/OpenGl data format experiment.

I hope to turn this into a tool to explore model formats using Lua script. Currently there is a minimal Lua interface to an OpenGl rendering window with hooks to draw points with a colour.

## Usage

This project was created with Visual Studio 2010 and includes the Lua/OpenGl libraries to run on Windows x86.

To reload the `expose.lua` script, press the **r** key.
